# Markdown to HTML Converter

This is a simple, single-file web application that dynamically converts Markdown content from an `input.md` file into HTML and renders it directly in the browser. It's built with responsiveness in mind, leveraging Tailwind CSS for a modern and clean user interface.

## How to Use

1.  **Save Files:** Ensure `index.html` and `input.md` are in the same directory.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file with your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3.  **View Content:** The markdown content from `input.md` will be automatically fetched, converted, and displayed.

## Technologies Used
